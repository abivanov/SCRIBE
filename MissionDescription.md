## Level 1:  Introduction
a. The MDD shall contain a description of the purpose, objective, content and
the reason prompting its preparation (e.g. logic, organization, process or
procedure).
## Level 1:  Applicable and reference documents
The MDD shall list the applicable and reference documents in support to
the generation of the document, and include, as a minimum, the current
preliminary technical requirements specification.
## Level 1: Technical requirements specification
Summary of key Technical requirements provided by LASP (Mass/Size, Power, Data, Key interfaces )
Autonomy requirements (no uplink)
## Level 1: Mission Description

### Level 2: 1. Overview of the concept
Brief overview - we're building effectively a cubesat that will function for 7 years in space to make a final descent onto the asteroid 267 Justitia. 
### Level 2: 2. Mission analysis
High level overview of the mission profile. 
### Level 2: 3 CONOPS 
we distinguish two main phases: pre-deployment (or cruise phase) and post deployment (after sepration from the main spacecraft towards the asteroid) . During the cruise phase, there the satellite will be be turned on for major events: fly-bys of asteroids and planets and aliveness check. 
#### Level 3: Pre-deployment 

##### Level 4: Fly bys 
we expect to fly by Venus, Earth, Mars as weell as 6 asteroids. 
Describe here how we're going to signal the fly-by mode 
##### Level 4: Aliveness 
Aliveness check is planned for all instruments during the cruise phase. Expected frequency once per year. 
#### Level 3: Deployment and Descent 
Describe CONOPS during descent with options depending on the asteroid gravity. 
### Level 2: 4. System description

### Level 2: Key Technical risks
The MDD shall provide the list of identified risk related to the concept,
including as a minimum technology, contingencies handling, and
programmatic aspects.
## Level 1:  Summary
The MDD shall summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the concept.
